    <h1>A site about my Odin Project Journey</h1>
    <p>For those of you that don't know what Odin Project is, it's a free site where you can <strong><a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/">learn programming for free</a></strong>, and this is a site where i would like to give you insight into my progress as well as train my new skills, and a sort of graphical progression as to how much I improved</p>
    <p>As of writing this I already messed up a bit by naming my file the wrong way ;)</p>
    <h2>First steps</h2>
    <h3>25th - 27th of September</h3>
    <p>Well anyways I started my programming journey on Odin 25th September 2023, When starting I learned a bit about motivation and how this is a sprint, not a marathon</p>
    <p>This was great, since I wasn't new to programming, I already tried some sites before but none of them had this kind of motivation thing in the beginning, and I can't stress this enough you absolutely need this, since everytime I tried programming before I lost my motivation here is some of the reasons why I lost my motivation:
        <ul>
            <li>Getting distracted</li>
            <li>Having struggle with my social life</li>
            <li>Thinking this is taking too long and I am never going to get to my goal</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>These are some of the things, not all, but you get the point, TOP(shortcut for The Odin Project) taught me that you don't have to be learning 10 hours a day, what's more important is consistency, learning 1 hour a day is better than 10 - 5 days and then quit</p>
    <p>Every other course was telling me this is going to be easy, you are going to be programmer in 5 months, while this can be true, it's demotivating once you get stuck on something, TOP tells you it's ok, just take your time</p>
    <h3>28th - 29th of September</h3>
    <p>So after learning about Motivation and How Internet Works it was time for me to get into practice</p>
    <h4>Git</h4>
    <p>First on the menu was learning Git, which is kind of your repository so you don't have to save your project all the time, and make hundreds of saves of old code, git does it for you so you can revisit it later, if you mess up your code you can go back in time, and basically undo the changes you made</p>
    <p>It also introduced me GitHub which I am sure I will use alot once i get hired for programming, it's basically a remote repository which all the people working on the project can access</p>
    <h3>HTML</h3>
    <p>And so I am here in HTML, so far I learned a few things:
    <ol>
        <li>Boilerplate</li>
        <li>And some elements:
            <ul>
                <li>p - paragraph</li>
                <li>h - header</li>
                <li>ol - ordered list</li>
                <li>ul - unordered list</li>
                <li>a - anchor(for links)</li>
                <li>img - this is for importing images</li>
                <li>dl - description list(which I don't know how to use correctly yet)</li>
                <li>em - epmhasis (makes text Italic)</li>
                <li>strong - makes the thext bold, and also puts higher emphasis on it when someone is using a reader</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
    And I also learned some attributes
    <ol>
        <li>a - atributes:
            <ul>
                <li>href - for links ( you either use absolute or relative path)</li>
                <li>target - so far i only know _blan</li>
                <li>and rel - noopener and noreferrer</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <!-- Just a comment again-->
        <li>img - atributes:
            <ul>
                <li>src - image attribute for importing images</li>
                <li>alt - for times image doesn't load or there is a screen reader</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>    
    </p>
